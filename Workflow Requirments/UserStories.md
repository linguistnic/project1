User Stories: Nico Ferrari

Astrology User: As an Astrologer, I would like to know how long Nico has been studying and practicing. I like the colors and fonts on the site, and think it adds an air of fun while also looking professional.
Linguistic User: As someone who wants to practice English, I would like to know what kind of services Nico offers. I think the site looks pretty, trustworthy, and even contains a lot of American slang, so I know he is a native speaker.
Web Development User: As someone who is constantly on the hunt for new talent in the web development world, I am excited to see Nico’s knack for creative and colorful sites to enrich the user’s experience. He can clearly have fun with the user, and interact with them without even communicating directly. I want to know more about him, and the contact page is easy and fun to use, so I will ask for his resume.
