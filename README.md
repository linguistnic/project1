Welcome to Nico Ferrari's First Ever Website!

I would like to first take some time to thank my parents and friends for helping me to stay focused and be diligent in my approach. I could not have made it this far in the course without their endless support and encouragement. You guys are G’s!

The concept of this project is to be reminiscent of a youthful summer camp. With a font like Lato, and bright, light colors reminiscent of ice cream parties and late-night deep talks in the cabin with friends, you can frolic around the site, and get lost in the summer breeze of memories past. 
I liked having a clear-cut and tight theme, so I could operate within that, and offer a simple, column-based site. I think I would have done just as well, though without a clear theme in mind. More on that later in Ideas for future improvement

The way to use the site is relatively straightforward, considering it’s a very simple website, structurally. There’s a home page (index), a contact page (contact) and an about page (about). The overall design of the webpage is supposed to resemble a waterfall nature, or perhaps dripping ice cream. Whatever the case, and how the user perceives it, it comes fully prepared with a navbar, a carousel, pre-made text content CSS (including some that don’t yet exist [textContent4; textContent5). All images have alt text, so it is accessible and able to be found on the web.

This project contains many different languages, including some that I personally didn’t write:
HTML
CSS (Styles.css - made by me) (Bootstrap - made by Bootstrap)
JavaScript (Bootstrap & JQuery)

Some Ideas for Future Improvement:
I would love to have the carousel change width, and if I felt it meshed well with my overall project, I would have done that. In reality, the carousel was just to show that I can implement the carousel. I just followed the requirement, and let it be.
I think I will work with styling my text with em’s so that they’re based off of the user’s device, and if they need to change the font for accessibility purposes, they can.
I would not have done such silly commit names. I didn’t know those comments were publicly viewable,  but no worries! I think it shows great personality.
